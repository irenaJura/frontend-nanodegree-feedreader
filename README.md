# Project Overview

This project contains web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I used Jasmine (http://jasmine.github.io/) to write the test suites.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.


## What will you learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How to do this yourself?

Go to https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader and clone the original Udacity repo. Then follow the instructions. Good luck!
